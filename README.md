# Digital Archives of the Atlantic Slave Trades

An open-access resource that will digitize, transcribe, translate, and
semantically link manuscript materials documenting the trans-Atlantic and
intra-American slave trades.

This API will allow indexing documents in federated [IIIF](https://iiif.io/)
servers and connecting them to Voyages and people of the Atlantic Slave Trade.
